      <p class="intro-text">It's pronounced Nish~ta. I'm a Front End Developer currently based in Charlotte, NC. I started my career in marketing, however around 2016 developed an interest in Frond End programming. After doing exercises on my own at home, taking online courses, building my own website, I decided to take steps toward a career change. Fortunately, at this time my company was holding an Internal Tech Academy where employees were accepted into a 6 month training program held outside of there current role that would prepare us for a career in Front End Development. After this course - I spent two years as a front end developer working on financial sites such as The Simple Dollar, CreditCards.com, and Bankrate. After 7 years in the workforce, 5 years at Red Ventures, and 2 years as a developer - I decided it was time to take everything I learned and work on projects on my own, while traveling. In December 2019 - I left home and was able to travel through India, the UK, and France until COVID-19 sent me home.</p>
