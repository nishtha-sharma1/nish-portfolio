      <p class="text__intro">
        I'm a Front End Developer currently based in Charlotte, NC. I started my career in marketing and quickly realized this was not the career I wanted to continue. In 2016 I developed an interest in Frond End Development.  I started taking online courses at home, building my own website, and realized this was something I would love to do full time and decided to take steps toward a career change. Fortunately, at this time the company I was working for developed an internal tech program that would prepare employees for a career change. This was a rigorous six month course to be completed outside our full time role. After this, I spent two years as a front end developer working on financial sites such as The Simple Dollar, CreditCards.com, and Bankrate. After 7 years in the workforce, 5 years at Red Ventures, and 2 years as a developer - I decided it was time to take everything I learned and work on projects of my own, while traveling.  In December 2019 - I left home and was able to travel through India, the UK, and France until COVID-19 sent me home.  My hobbies include - reading, traveling, learning, and most importantly - playing with my pup.
